/*
 Zip File Maker

 The user enters a path to a directory and the program zips up the directory items into several zip files.
 The program should zip up files of the given directory and all the sub-directories.
 The program supports such types:
 - audio (mp3, wav, wm);
 - video (avi, mp4, flv);
 - image (jpeg, jpg, gif, tiff, png);
 As the result you must have 3 archives: audio.zip, video.zip and image.zip.
 You can use File, FileFilter, (G)ZIPOutputStream or something else.
